<h3>What - Easy to use encrypted email with decentralized hosting</h3>

<p>Pixelated makes email encryption simple. While encryption tools can be cumbersome and difficult to learn, Pixelated offers a seamless user experience, a practical response to mass surveillance and an alternative to current centralized email applications.</p>

<p>Email is the most popular Internet application, with 2.5 billion users sending billions of messages each day.  Initially designed to have a decentralized protocol, “free” email services offered by giant corporations have centralized almost half of the world’s email content and metadata in one country, making it subject to the laws and surveillance habits of that country.</p>

<p>Pixelated will not protect against targeted surveillance, but when widely adopted will make mass surveillance more difficult and expensive. Pixelated will also re-decentralize data and communications for groups, companies and agencies running their own email server.  
Pixelated is open source software that values privacy and the human right to communicate. Unless software is open, we can’t verify that it is not corrupted or hiding surveillance and control measures.  Not only can you examine the code, you can help improve it.</p>

<h3>Why - Encryption resists mass surveillance & protects our right to privacy</h3>

<p>While many suspected, recent revelations have confirmed that entire populations are under dragnet surveillance, compromising our rights to privacy, freedom of association and freedom of expression.</p>

<p>That is why more and more people, organisations and businesses are encrypting. One study indicates that since the revelations, encrypted traffic in Europe has gone from 1.47 percent to 6.10 percent; in Latin America from 1.8 to 10.37. Another Global Study surveyed nearly 5000 businesses and found that encryption had gone up by 6% after recent revelations and that 35% of businesses have an encryption strategy.</p>

<p>Encryption makes good business sense - protecting client and customer data is necessary for guaranteeing safe financial transactions.  Confidentiality between lawyer and clients, doctors and patients, journalists and sources, priests and confessors are all recognised as essential for those institutions to function.  Without confidentiality, the notion of "innocent before proven guilty" becomes redundant and the idea of a free press is over.</p>

<p>Encrypting our communications is not hiding, suspicious or a crime.  Resisting the chilling effects of mass surveillance helps to restore rights, protect colleagues and fundamental principles upon which democracy rests in the digital age.</p>
