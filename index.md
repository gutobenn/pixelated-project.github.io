# Pixelated is a secure Open Source email solution

**Pixelated is in early development state! Things may not work to their full extend yet**

There are a few exciting things you will be able do with Pixelated in the future:

* Setup your own secure mail provider using the <a href="https://github.com/pixelated-project/pixelated-platform">Pixelated Platform</a>
* Connect to a secure mail provider through a self-hosted web client - the <a href="https://github.com/pixelated-project/pixelated-user-agent">Pixelated User Agent</a>
* Setup an enterprise secure mail solution by combining the Pixelated Platform and User Agent with the <a href="https://github.com/pixelated-project/pixelated-dispatcher">Pixelated Dispatcher</a>


## Key Features
* Compelling web-based user interface with fast search and tagging instead of folders
* An organisation setup that requires no software to be installed by the end user
* End-to-End encryption with maximum compatibility with existing solutions (i.e. use of PGP, SMTP/TLS)
* Developed with usability for administrators in mind: installing and maintaining Pixelated as frictionless as possible
* Built on the <a href="https://leap.se">LEAP Platform</a>
* Source code available on Github under AGPL license

## Why Pixelated - the problems we are trying to solve
* Mass surveillance
Email communication can be subject to dragnet surveillance. If we can achieve widespread use of secure communication, it will be too costly to routinely intercept the majority of communication on the internet. This does not mean that a motivated adversary will not be able to intercept specifically targeted communication, but it should end mass surveillance on the scale we have to endure today.

* Centralisation
In the current context, there is a high degree of concentration with regards to where the information that circulates through email is actually stored. If we can make it easy for organisations to host communication infrastructure, there will be less dependency on the major service providers, making it harder to obtain or compromise individualâ€™s communication.
